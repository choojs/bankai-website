## Introduction
The WEB PLATFORM is doing amazing! We have a multi-language, standardized
VIRTUAL MACHINE with a graphical layer running on virtually every device. If you
want to share your things with an audience, there’s nothing with a wider reach!

However, building for the WEB PLATFORM is by no means simple. There’s a lot
that’s possible, which means there’s a lot to learn. But that shouldn’t prevent
it from being easy to build things.

And that’s where BANKAI comes in. We wanted to have a tool that makes it easy to
build things for the web. And as the Web evolves, it figures out how to apply
the latest optimizations to your project. You shouldn’t need to be an expert to
do the right thing.

The same goes for tooling though. A lot of tools come with options, flags and
switches everywhere. It can take a while to learn. BANKAI does away with all
this, exposing 3 commands to perform 3 different tasks.
